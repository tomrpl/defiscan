          DeFiScan is an open platform providing information about the
          decentralization of third-party DeFi protocols ("Protocols"),
          including decentralization reviews ("Review(s)") as well as other
          content, features and tools (collectively "Content"). DeFiScan is
          provided as a freely available public good to further decentralization
          in DeFi by creating a common understanding and individualized
          measurement of decentralization in Protocols.
