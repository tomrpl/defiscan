- **Add New Protocol**:

New protocols reviews can be added as an `.md` file in the `content` folder.

`Important`:

- Make sure to name the file with dash (`-`) and without space. Example: `liquity-v2.md`
- The `.md` file needs to follow the protocol report structure outlined [here](src/content/template.md)
